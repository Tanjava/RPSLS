# Design

The design of the RPSLS game is simple and intuitive, with clear visuals and interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

The color scheme of the game is based on the logo and the yellow hand emojis. The following colors were chosen:

## Typography

The following fonts were used in the game:

- Stint Ultra Expanded: 
  - Used for the game title for a playful feel
- Orbitron

## Images

ü§è Pinching Hand (lizard)
üññ Vulcan Salute (Spock)


# Features

## Existing Features:

The RPSLS Game is a one-page game website with interactive elements and visual cues. Users can select their hand choice and play against the computer for 5 rounds. The player with the highest score at the end wins the game.


### Languages Used

- HTML5 
    - Used for structuring the content and elements of the game
- CSS3
    - Used for styling the website
- JavaScript
    - Used for implementing the game logic and interactivity

### Header

The header at the top of the page includes the game's title and logo. 

### Gameboard

The gameboard is the main section of the game that displays the user's and computer's scores, their choices (represented by large emoji images), and the game options (buttons).

### Scoreboard

The scoreboard displays the current scores for the user and the computer. The scores update dynamically as the game progresses based on the outcome of each round.

### Game option buttons

There are five game option buttons, each representing a different choice: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock. The buttons glow and subtly lift when the user hovers over them, making the game more engaging. Clicking on a button starts a game round. The winner of the round is determined based on the player's choice and the randomly generated computer's choice.

### Tooltip

Hovering over each button displays a brief tooltip providing information about the corresponding game move. This helps users understand the rules of the game and the strengths/weaknesses of each move.

### Visual Feedback

The default hand gesture displayed is 'Rock'. Each round, when the user selects their hand choice, the game visually updates the user's and computer's choices with the corresponding emoji images. After a couple of seconds it switches back to 'Rock', simulating how the game is played in real life before players reveal their next hand.

Furthermore, a message for each game outcome (win, lose, or tie) will be displayed after every round (e.g. "You win this round!") and at the end of the game with the final result (e.g. "Game Over. You Lose!").

### Game Rules

In the footer of the website, users can find the game rules. When clicked, a modal will appear with an image showing how the game is played. This can be helpful for new players who are unfamiliar with the expanded version of the game.

- Rock crushes Lizard and (as it always has) crushes Scissors.
- Paper covers Rock and disproves Spock.
- Scissors cuts Paper and decapitates Lizard.
- Lizard poisons Spock and eats Paper.
- Spock smashes Scissors and vaporizes Rock.

### Footer

The footer contains copyright information on the left, and the game rules on the right.


## Future Features

- Add a 'bounce' animation to the default 'Rock' hand emoji before the player's and computer's hands are shown. The game starts with 'Rock', then there's a countdown - 3(rock), 2(paper), 1(scissors), Shoot. On "Shoot" the choices are revealed.
- Add sound effects for each gesture to enhance gaming experience.



# What I Learned

During the development of the RPSLS game, I encountered a situation where I initially wrote a function called 'increaseScore' to increase the score of the winner, but later realized that I could achieve the same result without needing the function.

In the original code, after determining the winner of a round in the 'PlayGame' function, I called the 'increaseScore' function. Inside the 'IncreaseScore' function, I increased the corresponding score based on the winner.

Upon reviewing my code, I realized that I could simplify it by directly increasing the 'playerScore' or 'houseScore' variables within the 'playGame' function itself.

This taught me the importance of continuously reassessing and refining my code as I develop a project, and considering if the use of a function is necessary or if the same result can be achieved in a simpler and more straightforward way.


# Testing

The website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and Android devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 

Google DevTools was used to test different devices and screen resolutions. 

All buttons functioned as expected, as did the game itself.
